# ATM Security Enhancement using Computer Vision
<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

This is the report document for “ATM Security System using Face Recognition”.
Automatic Teller Machines, banking became a lot easier though with its own troubles of insecurity. Due to tremendous increase in the number of criminals and their activities, the ATM has become insecure. ATM systems today use no more than an access card and PIN for identity verification. The recent progress in biometric identification techniques, including finger printing, retina scanning, and facial recognition has made a great efforts to rescue the unsafe situation at the ATM. This research looked into the development of a system that integrates facial recognition technology into the identity verification process used in ATMs. An ATM model that is more reliable in providing security by using facial recognition software is proposed .The development of such a system would serve to protect consumers and financial institutions alike from intruders and identity thieves. This paper proposes an automatic teller machine security model that would combine a physical access card, a PIN, and electronic facial recognition that will go as far as withholding the fraudster’s card. If this technology becomes widely used, faces would be protected as well as PINs. However, it obvious that man‟s biometric features cannot be replicated, this proposal will go a long way to solve the problem of Account safety making it possible for the actual account owner alone purpose both the identification and authentication that card and PIN do.
Agile Process is used as the methodology.
Coding is going to be handle by Python, an object oriented approach. And the Database system is to be created using MYSQL .

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
With the technological advances in financial infrastructure, most bank customers prefer to use Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) and Internet websites for carrying out their banking transactions. Financial users especially utilize ATMs for physical transactions like cash withdrawal or cash deposit.
ATM fraud has recently become more widespread. This system used to avoid the ATM robberies and wrong person miss uses the ATM. In today’s world the main problem in ATM System is lack of Security. Due to this we hear many fraud, robbery cases in our day-to-day life. The main thread behind this is that robber or thief is using someone else debit card of their own personal profit.
In Many activities like this the culprit face is covered So, police have to face problem like identify the thief. In these cases there are some known persons of the victim who follow this activity.

<h3>Objective of Project</h3>

In this project we are developing the software for the enhancement of the ATM machine’s security. By the use of various types of technologies like python, ML, Deep Learning concept etc we are developing the software which detect weather the person withdraw money is wearing mask / cover, if yes then program will deny the permission till one removes the mask. Now when mask is removed the software will take picture of the person and save it in Database for any future reference.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

To avoid atm robberies and provide security for atm, To secure such a complex system will be even more difficult than design it. And now people just begin to discuss some issues of ATM security. It will provide some experience for us to implement security services in ATM network.
We thus develop an ATM model that is more reliable in providing security by using facial recognition software. By keeping the time elapsed in the verification process to a negligible amount we even try to maintain the efficiency of this ATM system to a greater degree. Biometrics as means of identifying and authenticating account owners at the Automated Teller Machines gives the needed and much anticipated solution to the problem of illegal transactions. In this paper, we have tried to proffer a solution to the much dreaded issue of fraudulent transactions through Automated Teller Machine by biometrics that can be made possible only when the account holder is physically present. Thus, it eliminates cases of illegal transactions at the ATM points without the knowledge of the authentic owner. Using a biometric feature for identification is strong and it is further fortified when another is used at authentication level.
